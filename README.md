The remaining hour will be used to solve any problems, and to deploy the site on github. 

QUESTIONS.

There are any restriction of the frameworks and libraries that we can use for the project?

The deploy of the demo can be done at the gh-pages on GitHub?

The content of “Other charts” section can be added from another source (like be written static on the html) or it needs to be from the iTunes API.
